- **Question:** Explain idiomatic programming

Right, let’s give idiomatic programming a whirl, Cockney-style:

Idiomatic programming, apples and pears (stairs) to the code,  
It’s when you write your scripts in the way that's most commonly showed.  
You don’t just bash out bits and bytes, any old how,  
You use the language’s slang, the best practice, right now.

It’s like chirping in Londoners’ talk, apples and pears for “stairs,”  
You use the lingo the locals get, so nobody glares.  
In code, that means writing JavaScript, Python, or Ruby the way,  
That other coders from that manor would certainly say.

If you’re slicing lists in Python, don’t do it the hard way,  
Grab your slice like a local and you’ll have a good day.  
If you’re looping in JavaScript, use `forEach` or a map,  
Don’t write it like it’s C, or your mates will clap-trap.

So in a nutshell, me old china plate (mate),  
Idiomatic code’s crystal (crystal clear), never second-rate.  
It follows the flavour, the rules you don’t see,  
So other coders get it—easy as can be!
