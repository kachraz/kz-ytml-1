- **Question:** What is smellpanty algoritm ?

Cor blimey, mate, "smellpanty algorithm" ain’t one I’ve heard down the market or round the Queen’s way! Sounds like a bit of porky pie, or maybe a typo, what d’you say? If you meant "smell-panty" with a wink and a nod, maybe it’s something cheeky on the web or a code name odd?

But in the world of ones and zeros, lingo legit,  
No "smellpanty algorithm" comes up, not even a bit.  
You got a deeper clue, or was it just a laugh?  
Let me know, and I’ll be your encyclopaedia half and half!
