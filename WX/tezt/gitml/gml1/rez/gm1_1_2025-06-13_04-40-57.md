Alright me ol’ china plate, let’s break it down in a jiffy!

**Idiomatic programming** is when you write code in a style that suits the language proper, like a cockney likes his rhyming—fitting in, not causing a bother. You wouldn’t put a square peg in a round hole, would you? It’s using the language’s features and quirks just how its creators intended, all smooth and easy as pie.

For example, in Python, you might say:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = [n * n for n in numbers]
```
That’s *idiomatic*. You could do the same with an old clunky loop, but it wouldn’t look at home—bit like wearing a bowler hat to the beach!

In other words, idiomatic code is the bee’s knees—clear, concise, and everyone in the know can read it with a smile, no apples and pears in the way.

So, programming idiomatically means writing code that’s right as rain for the language you use. Lovely jubbly!
