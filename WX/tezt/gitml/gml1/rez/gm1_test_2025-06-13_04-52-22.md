- **Question:** Explain idiomatic programming

Alright, cobber, I’ll give it a burl in my best rhyming twirl!

**Idiomatic programming** is doing code the local way,  
Like a true native of the lingo, not a tourist for the day.  
It means using all the tricks and rhythms that the language’s folks employ—  
Not making C code in Python or Java in Ruby (oy vey, that destroys the joy!).

Each language has its secret paths, traditions, and old gold,  
A “when in Rome, do as Romans do” set in syntax and in code.  
So in Python, you'll write “list comprehensions” to loop with class,  
But in Go, it’s “error returns” that give you a pass.

An idiomatic coder picks up these styles,  
Like Cockney rhymers with words that beguile.  
It makes code easier for locals to tweak,  
Less likely to break, and sharp as a beak.

So, to sum up the knack:  
Write code as the locals would, never off the track.  
Stick to the idioms, slang, and right calls—  
And your code will fit in, blending like walls!
